# Create records

Find, update and delete records.

The examples use the following prisma schema:

```prisma
model Post {
    id        String   @default(cuid()) @id
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())
    updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
    published Boolean
    title     String
    content   String?

    comments Comment[]
}

model Comment {
    id        String   @default(cuid()) @id
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())
    content   String

    post   Post @relation(fields: [postID], references: [id])
    postID String
}
```

### Delete a record

In a query, you can query for relations by using "Some" or "Every". You can also query for deeply nested relations.

```go
// get posts which have at least one comment with a title "My Title" and that post's comments are all "What up?"
posts, err := client.Post.FindMany(
    Post.Title.Equals("what up"),
    Post.Comments.Some(
        Comment.Title.Equals("My Title"),
    ),
).Exec(ctx)
```

## Next steps

If the go client shouldn't support for a query you need to do, read how you can use [raw sql queries](./09-raw.md).
