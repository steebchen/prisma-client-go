## Bug reports, feature requests, help

If you have any questions, feature requests, need help or want to report a bug, please search the [GitHub Go client issue tracker](https://github.com/steebchen/prisma-client-go/issues) for an existing issue, or create a new one.

For general questions about Prisma, please refer to the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/).

I also host a private [Go client community](community) where you can ask questions and get help.
