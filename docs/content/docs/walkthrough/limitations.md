# Limitations

Note that the Prisma Go client is in alpha status right now, and I'm actively working towards a beta and eventually a
production-ready version. It's missing a lot of features compared to the javascript client, but the core works robustly,
as the same Prisma query engine is used under the hood. if you run into something which is not supported, you can
always [fall back to using raw queries](raw.md).
