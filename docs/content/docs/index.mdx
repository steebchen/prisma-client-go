It's also recommended reading the [Prisma docs](https://prisma.io/docs) for all tooling around the Go client, like the [Prisma schema file](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/prisma-schema-file) or [Prisma migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate).
