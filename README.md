## Description

Prisma Client Go is an **auto-generated query builder** that enables **type-safe** database access and **reduces boilerplate**. You can use it as an alternative to traditional ORMs such as gorm, xorm, sqlboiler and most database-specific tools.

It is part of the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ecosystem. Prisma provides database tools for data access, declarative data modeling, schema migrations and visual data management.

## Getting started

To get started, [**read the quickstart tutorial**](https://goprisma.org/docs/getting-started/quickstart) to add Prisma to your project in just a few minutes.

You also might want to read [deployment tips](https://goprisma.org/docs/reference/deploy) and the [full API reference](https://goprisma.org/docs/reference).

## Status

The Go client is currently maintained by @steebchen and considered to be in alpha. I am actively looking for [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/steebchen) who can support the continuous maintenance and development of new features to finally make working with databases in Go fun. If you [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/steebchen) me, I will prioritize your issues and feature requests and will help you set up and answer any questions you have.
